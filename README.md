This is my Readme. There are many others like it but this one is mine. My Readme is my best friend. It is my life. I must
master it as I must master my life. Without me, my Readme is useless. Without my Readme, I am useless. I must read my
Readme true. I must read better than my enemy who is trying to outread me. I must read better than him, before he reads
better than me. I will. Before Morgan Freeman I swear this creed: my Readme and myself are defenders of my plugin, we
are the masters of our enemy, we are the saviors of my life. So be it, until there is no enemy, but peace. Amen.
